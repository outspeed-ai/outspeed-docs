<Info>
  Make sure you have gone over [QuickStart](/examples/quickstart) before trying
  this example.
</Info>

In this example, we will build a realtime commentator that provides commentary on a live poker tournament.
We accomplish by using screenshare to capture the live game on Youtube and microphone audio to interact with the commentator.

## **Creating a Sports Commentator in 4 steps**

This app will process input from your microphone, video from screenshare, send it to an LLM and convert the response back to voice.

- The full GitHub repository is available [here.](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed.git)

<Info>
  This application will initially support only English as the source language.

  <Step title="Start by cloning the repository">

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed.git
    cd examples/sports_commentator/
    ```

    <Tab title="Local Server">
    You will need the following environment variables:

    1. `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - You can get this by going to [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/) and clicking on the API key tab.
    2. `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - You can get this by visiting the [Gemini Developer Portal](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and navigating to the API keys section to generate a new key.
    3. `CARTESIA_API_KEY` - You can get this by going to [Cartesia Keys](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys) and clicking on the API key tab.

    All of these providers have a free tier. Once you have your keys, run the following command:

    ```bash
    export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your_deepgram_api_key>
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
    export CARTESIA_API_KEY=<your_cartesia_api_key>
    ```

    Finally, run the following command to start the server:

    ```bash
    python poker_commentator.py
    ```

    The console will output the URL you can use to connect to the server (default is http://localhost:8080).

        We will use our outspeed [Python SDK](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed.git) to deploy our application.

    ```bash
    outspeed deploy --api-key=<your-api-key> poker_commentator.py
    ```

    Your build will complete in seconds, and then you’ll receive a link to your deployed function on the Outspeed server. Copy the link.

    (Coming soon) You can also go to your app on the Outspeed dashboard and get the link.

  <Step title="Run Demo">
    We have already created a simple frontend using our [React SDK](/javascript/introduction).
 
  1. Open a Youtube video/stream of a poker tournament. Make sure the audio is muted and its full screen.
  2. In another tab, open the [Playground]( https://playground.outspeed.com/screen_share_input).
  3. Paste the link you received from the previous step into the URL field.
  4. Select your Audio device. Select the resolution. Click Run to begin.
  5. You will be prompted to share your screen. Select the Youtube tab and share it.
  6. Click Connect.

## **Understanding the Process**

Review the code in `poker_commentator.py`.

#### **Setup**

The `PokerCommentator` class initializes with the `setup` method, which is automatically called when the application starts. This method is responsible for setting up the necessary services and loading models. Here's a breakdown of the services initialized:

- **DeepgramSTT**: Converts spoken audio to text using Deepgram's speech-to-text API, configured with a sample rate of 8000 Hz.
- **KeyFrameDetector**: Analyzes video streams to detect significant moments, using a sensitivity threshold of 0.2 and a maximum time interval of 15 seconds between key frames.
- **GeminiVision**: Processes audio and video inputs to generate insightful poker commentary, guided by a detailed system prompt. It operates with a response temperature of 0.9 and maintains a chat history for context.
- **TokenAggregator**: Aggregates tokens from GeminiVision to form coherent responses.
- **ElevenLabsTTS**: Converts text responses back into spoken audio using Eleven Labs' text-to-speech API, optimized for low latency and using a specific voice model.

#### **Streaming Endpoint**

The `run` method in the `PokerCommentator` class is marked as a streaming endpoint, handling real-time audio and video streams. Here's how it processes these streams:

1. **Audio Processing**: The audio input stream is first converted to text using the `DeepgramSTT` service.
2. **Video Processing**: Simultaneously, the video input stream is analyzed by the `KeyFrameDetector` to identify key moments.
3. **Commentary Generation**: The text from Deepgram and the video analysis from KeyFrameDetector are then processed by `GeminiVision` to generate commentary.
4. **Token Aggregation**: The commentary tokens generated are refined by the `TokenAggregator` for coherence.
5. **Text-to-Speech**: The coherent text is then converted into spoken audio by `ElevenLabsTTS`.

The method outputs three streams: the audio stream of the commentary, the chat history text stream, and the cloned video input stream.
