<Info>
  Ensure you have completed the [Overview](/examples/function_calling/overview) before proceeding with this guide.
</Info>

In this guide, we will extend the basic Voice Bot by integrating a **Search Tool** that allows the bot to perform online searches based on user queries. This enhancement enables your bot to provide more accurate and up-to-date information by fetching data from the web in real-time.

## **Integrating Tools into Your Realtime API Voice Bot**

We will modify the existing Voice Bot to include a search functionality that interacts with the [Exa API](https://exa.ai/api). This involves creating a new tool, updating the bot's setup, and handling the search results.

- The full code is available [here.](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed/blob/main/examples/function_calling/voice_bot_with_online_search.py)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating Pydantic Models">
    To handle structured data within your tool, we utilize **Pydantic** models. These models provide type validation and ensure consistency across your application.

    ### **Define the Models**

    First, define the models for queries and search results.

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class Query(BaseModel):
        query: str

    class SearchResult(BaseModel):
        result: str
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate the Search Tool">
    <Warning>
      Ensure you're adding this to `voice_bot.py` created in [Get Started](/examples/get_started/quickstart) guide.
    </Warning>

    ### **Create the Search Tool**

    Create a new tool that interacts with the Exa API to perform searches.

    ```python
    import outspeed as sp

    class SearchTool(sp.Tool):
        name = "search"
        description = "Search the web for information"
        parameters_type = Query
        response_type = SearchResult

        async def run(self, query: Query) -> SearchResult:
            url = "https://api.exa.ai/search"
            headers = {
                "accept": "application/json",
                "content-type": "application/json",
                "x-api-key": os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"),  # Ensure EXA_API_KEY is set in your environment
            }
            payload = {
                "query": query.query,
                "type": "neural",
                "useAutoprompt": True,
                "numResults": 1,
                "contents": {"text": True},
            }

            async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
                try:
                    async with session.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload) as response:
                        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
                        data = await response.json()
                        # Process the response data as needed
                        return SearchResult(result=str(data.get("results", [{}])[0].get("text", "")))
                except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
                    logging.error(f"HTTP request failed: {e}")
                    return SearchResult(result="An error occurred while processing the search request.")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update the VoiceBot Setup">

    Modify the `setup` method to include the newly created `SearchTool`.

    ```python
    @sp.App()
    class VoiceBot:
        async def setup(self) -> None:
            # Initialize the AI services
            self.deepgram_node = sp.DeepgramSTT()
            self.llm_node = sp.OpenAILLM(
                tool_choice="required",
                tools=[
                    SearchTool(),
                ],
            )
            self.token_aggregator_node = sp.TokenAggregator()
            self.tts_node = sp.CartesiaTTS(
                voice_id="95856005-0332-41b0-935f-352e296aa0df",
            )
            self.vad_node = sp.SileroVAD(min_volume=0)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup API Keys (if running locally)">
    You will need the following environment variables:

    1. `EXA_API_KEY` - Sign up and navigate to [Exa API](https://exa.ai/) to get the API key.
    2. `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - Sign up and navigate to [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com/) to get the API key.
    3. `CARTESIA_API_KEY` - Sign up and navigate to [Cartesia](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys) to get the API key.
    4. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Sign up and navigate to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/keys) to get the API key.

    Once you have your keys, create a `.env` file in the same directory as `voice_bot_with_online_search.py` and add the following:

    ```bash
    EXA_API_KEY=<your_exa_api_key>
    DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your_deepgram_api_key>
    CARTESIA_API_KEY=<your_cartesia_api_key>
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
    ```

    Now you can run the following command to start the server:

    ```bash
    python voice_bot_with_online_search.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Understanding the Integration**

### **SearchTool Class**

The `SearchTool` class extends `sp.Tool` and is responsible for interacting with the Exa API to perform web searches based on user queries.

- **run Method**: This asynchronous method takes a `Query` object, sends a POST request to the Exa API with the query parameters, and returns a `SearchResult` object containing the search outcome.

### **VoiceBot Setup**

In the `setup` method of the `VoiceBot` class, we initialize the `llm_node` with the `SearchTool`. This setup allows the bot to utilize the search functionality alongside other AI services.
