## **Groq**

#### **Updating the Prompt and Model**

To update the prompt and model for GroqLLM in your voice bot, modify the `system_prompt` and `model` parameters when initializing the `GroqLLM` node:

```python
import outspeed as sp

@sp.App()
class VoiceBot:
    async def setup(self) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the VoiceBot.
        """
        # ... existing code ...
        self.llm_node = sp.GroqLLM(
            system_prompt="You are a friendly AI assistant. Provide concise and helpful responses.",
            model="llama-3.1-8b-instant",  # Choose from available models

## **Best Practices for Updating Prompts and Models**

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the role and behavior you want the AI to adopt in your prompt.
2. **Keep it Concise**: Avoid overly long prompts that might confuse the model.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: After updating the prompt or model, test your bot to ensure it behaves as expected.
4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompt based on the responses you get from the bot.
5. **Consider Model Capabilities**: Different models have different strengths and limitations. Choose a model that best fits your use case.
6. **Stay Updated**: LLM providers frequently release new models. Keep an eye on their documentation for the latest available models and their capabilities.

Remember, the effectiveness of your prompt and the choice of model can significantly impact the quality and relevance of your voice bot's responses. Experiment with different combinations to find the one that best suits your use case.

<Info>
  Always refer to the official documentation of each LLM provider for the most
  up-to-date list of available models and their specific capabilities.
