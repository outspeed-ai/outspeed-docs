## What is Realtime?

Realtime is a cutting-edge platform designed to facilitate the discovery, design, and implementation of AI features at scale. As the focus of AI development shifts from primarily training and fine-tuning to the integration of models for specific applications, Realtime provides an optimal development environment to support this trend.

Features include:

- Ability to create complex applications using multiple models with minimal coding
- Scalable, reliable infrastructure that adjusts based on traffic
- Advanced distributed mechanisms such as queues and asynchronous jobs for efficient data handling

## **Getting Started**

- [Sign up](https://www.getadapt.ai/dashboard) and obtain your [API key](https://www.getadapt.ai/dashboard/settings)
- Install the Realtime Python client
```bash
pip install realtime-client
```
{
  /*
  - Authenticate with your API key
  ```bash
  realtime login
  ```
  */
}

### **Creating a basic Voice Chatbot app**

Here's how to develop a straightforward Voice Chatbot application on Realtime. 
This app will process input from your microphone, send it to an LLM and convert that text to voice.

- The full github repository is available [here.](https://github.com/xAlpha8/realtime-client)

<Info>This application will initially support only English as the source language.</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start by creating a new directory and file">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xAlpha8/realtime-client && cd realtime-client/examples/voice_bot/
    ```

    Review the following code in `main.py`:
    ```python
    import realtime

    @realtime.webrtc()
    def simple_translation(file: realtime.File, target_language: str = "spa") -> str:
        """
        :param file: File to translate
        :param target_language: Language code to translate to. Defaults to "spa" for Spanish.
        """

        transcribe = realtime.function.get("realtime/speech_transcriber")
        translate = realtime.function.get("realtime/seamless_text2text")

        transcript = transcribe.run(file)
        translated_segments = []
        for segment in transcript:
            translate_job = translate.push(
                segment["text"],
                source_language="eng",
                target_language=target_language
            )
            translated_segments.append(translate_job)

        translated_transcript = ""
        for translated_seg in translated_segments:
            translated_transcript += translated_seg.result()

        return translated_transcript
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Realtime">
    <Warning>Ensure you're in the same directory as main.py!</Warning>
    ```bash
    realtime deploy
    ```

    Your build will complete in seconds, and then you'll receive a link to your deployed function on the Realtime dashboard.
    You can also go to your app on the [Realtime dashboard](https://www.getadapt.ai/dashboard) and get the link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the frontend">

    There is a server.py file in the same directory as main.py that will launch a basic HTML and Javascript frontend that will connect 
    to the serverless instance you deployed via WebRTC.

    <Info>Replace ```{insert_link}``` with the link received after realtime deploy.</Info>
    In another terminal, run:
    ```bash
    python server.py --backend {insert_link}
    ```
    You can then browse to the following page with your browser:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080

    Once you click `Start` the browser will send the audio and video from its
    webcam to the server.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Understanding the Process**

Creating this simple AI translation app was straightforward! The core of our application relied on two Realtime functions:
- [realtime/speech_transcriber](https://realtimeai.com/functions/realtime/speech_transcriber): A transcription model powered by OpenAI's Whisper.
- [realtime/seamless_text2text](https://realtimeai.com/functions/realtime/seamless_text2text): A translation model developed by Meta.

We encapsulated all translation logic in a single function and defined it as a [custom Realtime function](/guide/custom-apps/deploying-functions) using the `@realtime.function` decorator.

Deploying with `realtime deploy` allows API accessibility and visual tracking of inputs and outputs via the Realtime dashboard!
