In this guide, we'll explore how to experiment with different voices online and implement voice switching in your voice bot. We'll cover two popular text-to-speech (TTS) services: ElevenLabs and Cartesia TTS.

## **ElevenLabs**

ElevenLabs offers a wide range of high-quality voices that you can try out and customize.

#### **Trying Out Voices Online**

1. Visit the [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library).
2. Browse through the available voices or use the search function to find specific types of voices.
3. Click on a voice to hear a sample.
4. Copy the voice ID, which you'll need for the next step.

#### **Switching Voices in voice_bot.py**

To switch voices in your voice bot, you'll need to modify the `voice_id` parameter when initializing the `ElevenLabsTTS` node. Here's how to do it:

```python
import outspeed as sp

@sp.App()
class VoiceBot:
    async def setup(self) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the VoiceBot.
        """
        # ... existing code ...
        self.tts_node = sp.ElevenLabsTTS(
            voice_id="your_voice_id_here",   # Update this line
            model="eleven_multilingual_v2",  # Update the model
            volume=0.7,                      # Update the volume
            stability=0.7,                   # Update the stability
            similarity=0.7,                  # Update the similarity
        )
        # ... existing code ...
```
