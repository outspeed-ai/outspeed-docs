In this guide, we'll explore how to add languages to your voice bot.

## **Azure Transcriber**

Azure Transcriber supports a wide range of languages.

#### **Trying Out Languages Online**

1. Visit the [Azure Transcriber page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support).
2. Note the language codes, which you'll need for the next step.

## **Adding Additional Languages in `voice_bot.py`**

To support additional languages in your VoiceBot, update the `languages` parameter in the `AzureTranscriber` node. Follow these steps:

```python
import outspeed as sp

@sp.App()
class VoiceBot:
    async def setup(self) -> None:s
      """
      Initialize the VoiceBot.
      """
      # ... existing code ...
      self.transcriber_node = sp.AzureTranscriber(
          languages=["en-US", "fr-FR", "es-ES"]  # Added Spanish (es-ES)
      )
      # ... existing code ...
```

### **Steps to Add a New Language:**

1. **Identify the Language Code:**
   - Refer to the [Azure Cognitive Services Speech-to-Text documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support) to find the appropriate language code for the language you want to add.

2. **Update the `languages` List:**
   - In `voice_bot.py`, locate the `AzureTranscriber` initialization within the `setup` method.
   - Add the new language code to the `languages` list. For example, to add Spanish, include `"es-ES"`.

3. **Restart the VoiceBot:**
   - After updating the code, restart your VoiceBot to apply the changes.

4. **Test the New Language:**
   - Verify that the VoiceBot correctly processes audio in the newly added language.


By following these steps, you can easily expand the language capabilities of your VoiceBot to cater to a broader audience.
