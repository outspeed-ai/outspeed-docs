<Info>
  Ensure you have completed the [Get Started with Realtime API](/examples/openai_realtime/quickstart) before proceeding with this guide.
</Info>

In this guide, we will extend the basic Voice Bot by integrating a **Search Tool** that allows the bot to perform online searches based on user queries. This enhancement enables your bot to provide more accurate and up-to-date information by fetching data from the web in real-time.

## **Integrating Tools into Your Realtime API Voice Bot**

We will modify the existing Voice Bot to include a search functionality that interacts with the [Exa API](https://exa.ai/api). This involves creating a new tool, updating the bot's setup, and handling the search results.

- The full code is available [here.](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed/blob/main/examples/openai_realtime/voice_bot_with_online_search.py)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating Pydantic Models">
    To handle structured data within your tool, we utilize **Pydantic** models. These models provide type validation and ensure consistency across your application.

        ### **Define the Models**

        First, define the models for queries and search results.

        ```python
        from pydantic import BaseModel

        class Query(BaseModel):
            query: str

        class SearchResult(BaseModel):
            result: str
        ```
    </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate the Search Tool">
    <Warning>
      Ensure youâ€™re adding this to `voice_bot_rt.py` created in [Get Started with Realtime API](/examples/openai_realtime/quickstart) guide.
    </Warning>

    ### **Create the Search Tool**

    First, create a new tool that interacts with the Exa API to perform searches.

    ```python
    class SearchTool(sp.Tool):
        async def run(self, query: Query) -> SearchResult:
            url = "https://api.exa.ai/search"
            headers = {
                "accept": "application/json",
                "content-type": "application/json",
                "x-api-key": os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"),  # Ensure EXA_API_KEY is set in your environment
            }
            payload = {
                "query": query.query,
                "type": "neural",
                "useAutoprompt": True,
                "numResults": 1,
                "contents": {"text": True},
            }

            async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
                try:
                    async with session.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload) as response:
                        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
                        data = await response.json()
                        # Process the response data as needed
                        return SearchResult(result=str(data.get("results", [{}])[0].get("text", "")))
                except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
                    logging.error(f"HTTP request failed: {e}")
                    return SearchResult(result="An error occurred while processing the search request.")
    ```

    ### **Update the VoiceBot Setup**

    Modify the `setup` method to include the newly created `SearchTool`.

    ```python
    @sp.App()
    class VoiceBot:
        async def setup(self) -> None:
            # Initialize the AI services
            self.llm_node = sp.OpenAIRealtime(
                tools=[
                    SearchTool(
                        name="search",
                        description="Search the web for information",
                        parameters_type=Query,
                        response_type=SearchResult,
                    )
                ]
            )
    ```
    ### **Setup API Keys (if running locally)**
      You will need the following environment variables:

      1. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - You can get this by visiting the [OpenAI Realtime API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) and navigating to the API keys section to generate a new key.
      2. `EXA_API_KEY` - You can get this by visiting the [Exa API documentation](https://exa.ai/docs) and navigating to the API keys section to generate a new key.

      Once you have your keys, create a `.env` file in the same directory as `voice_bot_with_online_search.py` and add the following:

      ```bash
      OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
      EXA_API_KEY=<your_exa_api_key>
      ```

      Now you run the following command to start the server:

      ```bash
      python voice_bot_with_online_search.py
      ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Understanding the Integration**

### **SearchTool Class**

The `SearchTool` class extends `sp.Tool` and is responsible for interacting with the Exa API to perform web searches based on user queries.

- **run Method**: This asynchronous method takes a `Query` object, sends a POST request to the Exa API with the query parameters, and returns a `SearchResult` object containing the search outcome.

### **VoiceBot Setup**

In the `setup` method of the `VoiceBot` class, we initialize the `llm_node` with the `SearchTool`. This setup allows the bot to utilize the search functionality alongside other AI services.
