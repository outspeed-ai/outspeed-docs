## What is Outspeed?

Outspeed is a platform for realtime voice and video AI applications.
The Outspeed SDK provides a simple and intuitive interface for building real-time voice and video AI applications.
It abstracts away the complexities of handling multimedia inputs, allowing developers to focus on creating powerful multimodal AI experiences.

Key features of the Outspeed SDK include:

- Easy-to-use API inspired by **PyTorch**
- Built-in support for processing voice and video inputs
- Seamless integration with various AI models and services
- Real-time processing capabilities for responsive applications

Now, let's get started!

## Demo

In this quick start guide, we'll demonstrate how to build a voice bot using Outspeed.
This bot can engage in real-time conversations and respond based on the LLM prompt.

Below, you'll find a brief video demonstration showcasing the capabilities of the voice bot:

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following installed:

1. Python: version 3.9 or higher, but less than 3.13
2. pip: latest version (comes with Python)
3. Git: for cloning the repository

## **Creating a Voice Bot in 4 steps!**

This app will process input from your microphone, send it to an LLM and convert the reponse back to voice.

<Info>
  This application only supports English as the source language. For other
  languages, switch out the models/configs used in this example.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Install package">

  import InstallOutspeedSnippet from "/snippets/install-outspeed.mdx";
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    <InstallOutspeedSnippet />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Backend">
  <Warning>
  Navigate to `outspeed/examples/voice_bot` to view `voice_bot.py` code!
  </Warning>

`voice_bot.py` contains implementation of `@outspeed.App` annotated class which implements a low-latency conversational voice bot using `outspeed` SDK.

<Tab title="Local Server">
To run this example locally, you'll need API keys setup in the environment variables for the following services:
1. [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) - For transcription. Sign up and navigate to https://console.deepgram.com/ to get the API key.
2. [Groq](https://groq.com/) - For LLM. Sign up and navigate to https://console.groq.com/keys and to get the API key.
3. [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai/) - For text-to-speech. Sign up and navigate to https://play.cartesia.ai/keys to get the API key.

All of these providers have a free tier. Once you have your keys, run the following command:

```bash
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your_deepgram_api_key>
export GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
export CARTESIA_API_KEY=<your_cartesia_api_key>
```

Finally, run the following command to start the server:

```bash
# in examples/voice_bot
python voice_bot.py
```

The console will output the URL you can use to connect to the (default is http://localhost:8080).

<Tab title="Outspeed Cloud">
<Info>
  Make sure you have obtained an Outspeed API key before running this example. To
  obtain an API key [Contact us](mailto:contact@outspeed.com)
</Info>
    We will use our outspeedÂ [Python SDK](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed.git)Â to deploy our application.

```bash
outspeed deploy --api-key=<your-api-key> voice_bot.py
```

Your build will complete in seconds, and then youâ€™ll receive a link to your deployed function on the Outspeed server. Copy the link.

(Coming soon) You can also go to your app on theÂ Outspeed dashboardÂ and get the link.

  <Step title="Try it Out">
  You can use our [playground](https://playground.outspeed.com) to interact with the voice bot.
  
  1. Navigate to [playground](https://playground.outspeed.com) and select "WebRTC"
  2. Paste the link your received from the previous step into the URL field.
  3. Select Audio device. Leave Video device blank. Click **Run** to begin.

The playground is built using our ourÂ [React SDK](/javascript/introduction).
You can use it to build your own frontends, or integrate with an existing one!
