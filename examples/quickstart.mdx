<Tab title="Local Server">
You will need the following environment variables:

1. `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` - You can get this by going to https://console.deepgram.com/ and clicking on the API key tab.
2. `GROQ_API_KEY` - You can get this by going to https://console.groq.com/keys and clicking on the API key tab.
3. `CARTESIA_API_KEY` - You can get this by going to https://play.cartesia.ai/keys and clicking on the API key tab.

All of these providers have a free tier. Once you have your keys, run the following command:

```bash
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your_deepgram_api_key>
export GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
export CARTESIA_API_KEY=<your_cartesia_api_key>
