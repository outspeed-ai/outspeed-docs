description: "Meeting bot that can join a Zoom Meeting"

In this example, we will build a ZoomBot that connects to a zoom meeting.

## Demo


## Create a chatbot

First, refer to the example in [3D Avatar Voice Bot](/examples/3d_chatbot) to create the backend.

## Join Zoom Meeting

Once the function is deployed, you'll get the link for the function on Adapt's infrastructure.

For any zoom meeting, send the following payload to our backend to have your Avatar join the meeting

```
{
  meeting_id: <meeting_id>,
  function_url: <function_url>
}
```

Send the request to:

```
POST "https://getadapt.ai/stream"
```
