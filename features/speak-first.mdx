## Overview

The `first_message` field allows your AI agent to start the conversation automatically with a predefined greeting, instead of waiting for the user to speak first.

## Basic Usage

Add `first_message` to your session configuration:

```javascript
const sessionConfig = {
  // rest of config...
  first_message: "Hello! How can I help you today?",
};
```

When the session starts, the agent will immediately speak this message to greet the user.

## Examples

### Professional Assistant

```javascript
first_message: "Good morning! I'm your AI assistant. What can I help you with today?"
```

### Customer Support

```javascript
first_message: "Hi there! Welcome to our support chat. How can I assist you?"
```

### Interview Bot

```javascript
first_message: "Hello! I'm excited to conduct your interview today. Shall we get started?"
```

### Casual Companion

```javascript
first_message: "Hey! Great to see you. What's on your mind?"
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep it brief**: Short, welcoming messages work best
- **Match your brand**: Use language that fits your application's tone
- **Stay consistent**: Use similar greetings across sessions

## Optional Field

The `first_message` field is optional. If you don't include it, the session will start in listening mode, waiting for the user to speak first.
