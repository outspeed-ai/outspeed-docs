## Overview

System tools are pre-built tools that run on Outspeed's servers. They handle common conversation management tasks and require no implementation on your part - simply enable them in your session configuration.

System tools help agents manage conversation flow intelligently:

- **Server-side execution**: No client-side implementation needed
- **Automatic decisions**: Agents call tools based on conversation context
- **Override capabilities**: Customize tool behavior with custom descriptions
- **Zero maintenance**: Tools are maintained and updated by Outspeed

## Available System Tools

### Skip Turn
Allows agents to intelligently skip their speaking turn when users aren't directly addressing them.

**Use Cases:**
- User is singing or humming
- Background conversations
- User talking to someone else
- Self-talk or thinking aloud

### End Session
Enables agents to gracefully terminate conversations when users explicitly say goodbye.

**Use Cases:**
- User says "goodbye", "bye", "farewell"
- Clear conversation conclusion
- Explicit requests to end the call

## Basic Configuration

Enable system tools in your session configuration:

```javascript
const sessionConfig = {
  // rest of config...
  system_tools: [
    { name: "skip_turn", enabled: true },
    { name: "end_call", enabled: true }
  ],
};
```

## Override Tool Descriptions

You can customize how system tools behave by overriding their descriptions:

```javascript
const sessionConfig = {
  // rest of config...
  system_tools: [
    {
      name: "skip_turn",
      enabled: true,
      description: "Skip turns more conservatively - only when user is clearly singing or talking to others",
      parameter_descriptions: {
        reason: "Specific reason for skipping (singing or talking to others only)",
      },
    },
    {
      name: "end_call", 
      enabled: true,
      description: "End calls only on very explicit goodbye phrases like 'goodbye' or 'bye'",
      parameter_descriptions: {
        farewell_message: "Brief, professional farewell message",
        reason: "Specific goodbye phrase that triggered the end",
      },
    }
  ],
};
```


## Best Practices

### When to Enable
- **Skip Turn**: Recommended for most applications to handle natural conversation flow
- **End Session**: Essential for applications where users initiate call termination

### Override Examples

**More Restrictive Skip Turn:**
```javascript
{
  name: "skip_turn",
  description: "Only skip when absolutely certain user is not addressing the agent",
  parameter_descriptions: {
    reason: "Very specific reason with high confidence",
  },
}
```

**More Permissive End Session:**
```javascript
{
  name: "end_call",
  description: "End calls when users show any sign of wanting to conclude",
  parameter_descriptions: {
    farewell_message: "Warm, understanding farewell",
    reason: "Any indication user wants to end conversation",
  },
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Working
1. **Check configuration**: Ensure tools are properly enabled
2. **Verify session**: Confirm tools are included in session config
3. **Review logs**: Check for error messages in session events

### Unexpected Behavior
1. **Monitor context**: Review conversation context when tools trigger
2. **Adjust descriptions**: Override tool descriptions to fine-tune behavior
3. **System prompt**: Ensure your system prompt doesn't conflict with tool usage

### Performance Impact
- System tools have minimal performance impact
- No client-side processing required
- Server-side execution is optimized and fast
