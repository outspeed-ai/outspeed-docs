## Overview

Tools extend your AI agents with external capabilities, allowing them to interact with APIs, perform actions, and access real-time information during voice conversations.

## Tool Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Client Tools" icon="code" href="client-tools">
    Custom functions you define and implement in your application. When the agent needs to use a tool, it sends a
    request to your client, which executes the function and returns the result.
  </Card>
  <Card title="System Tools" icon="server" href="system-tools">
    Pre-built tools that run on Outspeed's servers. They handle common conversation management tasks and require no
    implementation on your part.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Examples

See real implementations of tools in action in our [Examples Repository](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed-examples). The repository includes working examples with:

- **Weather tool integration** (client tool)
- **Skip turn and end call** (system tools)
- **Multiple frameworks**: React, Next.js, Swift iOS, and more

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your tools**: Decide which client tools you need and which system tools to enable
2. **Implement client tools**: Write functions for your custom tools
3. **Configure session**: Add tools to your session configuration

## Benefits

- **Extended Capabilities**: Agents can access real-time data and perform actions
- **Natural Integration**: Tool usage feels seamless in conversation
- **Flexible Architecture**: Combine client and system tools as needed
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup and override options
