## Overview

Voice cloning allows you to create highly realistic custom AI voices from your own audio samples. This enables a personalized and branded voice experience for your applications.

1. **Upload Audio**: Provide clear audio samples of the voice you want to clone
2. **Generate Voice**: Outspeed's AI processes the samples to create a new voice
3. **Use in Apps**: Integrate your custom voice into your agents and TTS requests

<Note>Cloned voices are currently only available for use with our [Text-to-Speech (TTS) API](/api-spec/tts).</Note>

## Getting Started

1. **Visit Dashboard**: Go to the [Voice Upload page](https://dashboard.outspeed.com/tts/upload-voice) in your Outspeed Dashboard
2. **Upload Samples**: Follow the instructions to upload your audio files
3. **Create Voice**: Once processed, your new voice will be available to use
4. **Copy Voice ID**: Copy the generated Voice ID for use in your code

## Audio Requirements

- **Length**: Minimum 10 seconds of clear speech
- **Size**: Maximum 3 MB
- **Quality**: High-quality audio (e.g., studio recording, no background noise)
- **Format**: Only WAV files are supported
- **Content**: Natural speech, varied tone and pitch

<Warning>
  **Do not upload copyrighted material or impersonate individuals without consent.** Ensure you have the necessary
  rights for all uploaded audio.
</Warning>

## Usage

Once you have your custom Voice ID, use it with our [Text-to-Speech (HTTP)](/api-spec/tts):

### In TTS API Requests

```json
{
  "model": "outspeed-tts-v2",
  "voice": "your-custom-voice-id",
  "text": "This is my custom voice."
}
```

### In Dialogue Generation

```json
{
  "model": "outspeed-tts-v2",
  "text": "*Narrator:* This is my custom voice. Character: Hello!",
  "speaker_voice": "your-custom-voice-id",
  "narrator_voice": "another-custom-voice-id"
}
```

## Best Practices

- **High-quality audio**: Crucial for best results
- **Consent**: Always obtain consent if cloning a real person's voice
- **Monitor usage**: Track how your custom voices perform in real applications
