# Introduction

Outspeed powers voice companions and agents by providing natural emotive voice with memory. It's like having thousands of digital humans that can hold natural-sounding conversations with emotions, remember things, and carry out tasks on a computer.

Outspeed provides a Live API that companies, developers, and individuals can use to bring voice companions and agents to their applications, services, and use-cases. We offer an **OpenAI Realtime API compatible interface** to interact with models hosted on Outspeed's infrastructure.
