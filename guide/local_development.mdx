## Local Development

### Prerequisites

For local development, you need:
1. `node` and `npm`
2. `python`

### Environment Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone examples">

To test your application locally, you can replicate our examples repository

```
git clone https://github.com/outspeed-ai/examples
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup frontend">
    To setup the frontend, run the following terminal commands
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash MacOS/Linux
    # Navigate to examples/playground directory
    cd ./examples/playground
    # Install npm packges 
    npm i
    # Run the dev server
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```batch Windows
    REM Navigate to examples/playground directory
    cd .\examples\playground
    REM Install npm packges 
    npm i
    REM Run the dev server
    npm run dev
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Navigate to the URL printed in the terminal window.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run backend">
        Navigate to the `rt-apps` directory. Run and use the `starter.py` as a base for your applications.
        ```bash MacOS/Linux
        # Navigate to examples/rt-apps`
        cd ./examples/rt-apps
        # Install realtime-client if not installed
        pip install realtime-client
        # Run
        python starter.py
        ```
        You'll get the function endpoint when running it. By default, it's set to `http://localhost:8080`.
        <Info>
        If you get a `ModuleNotFoundError`, then check if you've installed `realtime-client`. Some examples require additional dependencies that you can install using `pip install realtime-client[extras]`.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test">
        Navigate to the running playground in your browser.
        Enter the function URL, select the inputs that your function takes, and hit **Run**.

        <Warning>
        If there's an error or the page looks frozen, check the terminal window where the function is running for clues.
        </Warning>
        <Warning>
        Make sure to select the inputs which match the input arguments in the endpoint running in your realtime function. `starter.py` accepts audio, video and text inputs and loops them back.
        </Warning>
    </Step>
</Steps>
