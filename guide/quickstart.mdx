## What is Real-time?
Realtime is a cutting-edge platform designed to facilitate the design and implementation of multi-modal AI features at scale.
    
Features include:
* Ability to create complex applications using multiple AI models with minimal coding.
* Scalable, reliable serverless infrastructure that adjusts based on traffic


## Demo

Here's a short demo of what the voice bot looks like:

### **Creating a Voice Bot in 3 steps!**

This app will process input from your microphone, send it to an LLM and convert the reponse back to voice.
<Info>
  This application will initially support only English as the source language.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start by cloning the repository">

    
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/xAlpha8/realtime-examples.git
    cd realtime-examples/
    ```
    Using Poetry:
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/xAlpha8/realtime-examples.git
    cd realtime-examples/
    ```
    Using Pip:
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/xAlpha8/realtime-examples.git
    cd realtime-examples/
    ```

   

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Realtime">
  <Warning>
  Ensure you’re in the same directory as voice_bot.py!
</Warning>
    We will use our realtime [Python SDK](/python_client) to deploy our application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xAlpha8/realtime-examples.git
cd realtime-examples/
```
Your build will complete in seconds, and then you’ll receive a link to your deployed function on the Realtime server. Copy the link.

(Coming soon) You can also go to your app on the Realtime dashboard and get the link.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Front-End">
  We have already created a simple frontend using our [React SDK](/react_client).

  Change directory to the frontend directory.
 
      ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/xAlpha8/realtime-examples.git
    cd realtime-examples/
    ```
    Install the dependencies and run the frontend.
    ```bash 
    npm install
    cd ./multimodal_ai_demos/backend/
    ```
    ```bash 
    npm run dev
    cd ./multimodal_ai_demos/backend/
    ```

    This will launch a simple frontend to interact with the backend. You can then browse to the following page with your browser:

    http://127.0.0.1:5173

Select Audio and Video and Click Start to begin.
