Outspeed's Python SDK provides a powerful and flexible way to build realtime AI applications on top of video, voice, and text data.
In this quickstart guide, we'll create a simple and interactive voice bot.

## Demo

Here's a short demo of what the voice bot looks like:

### **Creating a Voice Bot in 3 steps**

This app will process input from your microphone, send it to an LLM and convert the response back to voice.
<Info>
  This application will initially support only English as the source language.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install python SDK">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash MacOS/Linux
    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv .venv
    # Activate the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # Install the realtime-client package
    pip install realtime-client
    ```

    ```batch Windows
    REM Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    REM Activate the virtual environment
    call .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    REM Install the realtime-client package
    pip install realtime-client
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your realtime application">
    Use realtime [Python SDK](/python_client) to create and deploy your application.

    Create a file named `voice_bot.py` with this code:

```python
# voice_bot.py
import realtime as rt

# Wrap you application with @rt.App() decorator
@rt.App()
class VoiceBot:
    # VoiceBot class represents a voice-based AI assistant.

    async def setup(self) -> None:
        # Set up the AI service pipeline
        self.stt_node = rt.DeepgramSTT(sample_rate=8000)
        self.llm_node = rt.FireworksLLM(system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.")
        self.token_aggregator_node = rt.TokenAggregator()
        self.tts_node = rt.CartesiaTTS(voice_id="95856005-0332-41b0-935f-352e296aa0df")

    @rt.streaming_endpoint()
    async def run(self, audio_input_queue: rt.AudioStream) -> rt.AudioStream:
        # take in AudioStream input, pass it through nodes, and return audio
        stt_stream: rt.TextStream = self.stt_node.run(audio_input_queue)
        llm_token_stream, _ = self.llm_node.run(stt_stream)
        token_aggregator_stream: rt.TextStream = self.token_aggregator_node.run(llm_token_stream)
        tts_stream: rt.AudioStream = self.tts_node.run(token_aggregator_stream)

        return tts_stream

    async def teardown(self) -> None:
        self.stt_node.close()
        self.llm_node.close()
        self.tts_node.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start the VoiceBot when the script is run directly
    VoiceBot().start()

```
    Hit save on the file. Your application code is fully contained in `voice_bot.py`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Application">
    <Info>
      Make sure that you're in the same directory as `voice_bot.py` before running the commands.
    </Info>

    To deploy your application, use the `realtime` CLI command

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash MacOS/Linux
    # set your OUTSPEED_API_KEY
    export OUTSPEED_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
    # deploy your application
    realtime deploy --api-key=$OUTSPEED_API_KEY voice_bot.py
    ```

    ```batch Windows
    REM set your OUTSPEED_API_KEY
    set OUTSPEED_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
    REM deploy your application
    realtime deploy --api-key=%OUTSPEED_API_KEY% voice_bot.py
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Your app will spin-up in seconds, and then you'll receive a link to your deployment.
    Copy the link.

    Navigate to [Outspeed Playground](https://outspeed.ai/playground), paste your function link
    and hit **Run** to give your application a spin.

    (Coming soon) You can also go to your app on the [Realtime dashboard](https://www.outspeed.ai/dashboard) and get the link.
