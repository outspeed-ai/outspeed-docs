# ElevenLabs Swift Compatibility

OutspeedSDK is fully compatible with Elevenlabs Swift SDK specifications (with exception of some features.)

If you are migrating from ElevenLabsSDK, follow these steps:

## 1. Replace Imports and Configs

Replace all occurrences of `ElevenLabsSDK` with `OutspeedSDK`. For example:

```swift
import ElevenLabsSDK

let config = ElevenLabsSDK.SessionConfig( agentId : "testagent")
```

becomes

```swift
import OutspeedSDK

let config = OutspeedSDK.SessionConfig( agentId : "testagent")
```

## 2. Add Your Outspeed API Key

Update your `startSession` call to include your Outspeed API key:

```swift
let conversation = try await ElevenLabsSDK.Conversation.startSession(
    config: config,
    callbacks: callbacks
)
```

becomes

```swift
let conversation = try await OutspeedSDK.Conversation.startSession(
    config: config,
    callbacks: callbacks
    apiKey: "<YOUR_OUTSPEED_API_KEY>"
)
```

Refer to a working example on [GitHub](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed-examples/tree/main/swift-ios-basic).
