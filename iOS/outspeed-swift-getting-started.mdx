# Getting Started with Outspeed Swift SDK

A Swift SDK for the Outspeed API that enables realtime voice conversations using WebRTC technology.

```

And add `OutspeedSDK` to your target dependencies:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: ["OutspeedSDK"]),
```

### Xcode

1. Open Your Project in Xcode

2. Add Package Dependency
   - Go to `File` > `Add Packages...`
3. Enter Repository URL in the Search Bar

6. Ensure `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` is added to your Info.plist to explain microphone access.

## Requirements

- iOS >=18.0
- Swift 6.1+

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```swift
import OutspeedSDK

// Create a session configuration
let config = OutspeedSDK.SessionConfig( agentId : "testagent")

// Create callbacks to handle events
let callbacks = OutspeedSDK.Callbacks()
callbacks.onMessage = { message, role in
    print("Received message from \(role.rawValue): \(message)")
}

callbacks.onError = { message, error in
    print("Error: \(message)")
}

callbacks.onStatusChange = { status in
    print("Status changed to: \(status.rawValue)")
}

// Start the conversation
Task {
    do {
        let conversation = try await OutspeedSDK.Conversation.startSession(
            config: config,
            callbacks: callbacks
            apiKey: "<YOUR_OUTSPEED_API_KEY>"
        )

        // When done with the conversation
        conversation.endSession()
    } catch {
        print("Failed to start conversation: \(error)")
    }
}
```
