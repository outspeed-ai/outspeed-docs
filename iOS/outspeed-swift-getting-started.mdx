## Requirements

- iOS 15.2 or later
- Swift 6.1+

## Basic Usage

Here's the minimal code to get a voice conversation working:

```swift
import OutspeedSDK

// Create a session configuration
let config = OutspeedSDK.SessionConfig()

// Create callbacks to handle events
let callbacks = OutspeedSDK.Callbacks()
callbacks.onMessage = { message, role in
    print("Received message from \(role.rawValue): \(message)")
}

callbacks.onError = { message, error in
    print("Error: \(message)")
}

callbacks.onStatusChange = { status in
    print("Status changed to: \(status.rawValue)")
}

// Start the conversation
Task {
    do {
        let conversation = try await OutspeedSDK.Conversation.startSession(
            config: config,
            callbacks: callbacks,
            apiKey: "<YOUR_OUTSPEED_API_KEY>"
        )

        // When done with the conversation
        conversation.endSession()
    } catch {
        print("Failed to start conversation: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Customization

### System Prompt and First Message

```swift
let agentConfig = OutspeedSDK.AgentConfig(
    prompt: "You are a helpful assistant with a witty personality.",
    firstMessage: "Hey there, how can I help you with Outspeed today?"
)

let config = OutspeedSDK.SessionConfig(
    overrides: OutspeedSDK.ConversationConfigOverride(agent: agentConfig)
)
```

### Voice Selection

```swift
let ttsConfig = OutspeedSDK.TTSConfig(voiceId: OutspeedSDK.Voice.david.rawValue)

let config = OutspeedSDK.SessionConfig(
    overrides: OutspeedSDK.ConversationConfigOverride(tts: ttsConfig)
)
```
