<Note>
  We assume you have already deployed your backend. If not, please follow 
  [this tutorial](/outspeed_sdk/cli/deploy) to deploy your backend with `outspeed-client`.
</Note>

Let's create a mobile application using React Native to connect to the Outspeed backend. 
If you haven't already set up a React Native (or Expo) app, you can follow the 
[official setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to get started.



<Steps>
<Step title="Install the necessary dependencies">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @outspeed/core @outspeed/react-native react-native-webrtc react-native-incall-manager
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @outspeed/core @outspeed/react-native react-native-webrtc react-native-incall-manager
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @outspeed/core @outspeed/react-native react-native-webrtc react-native-incall-manager
```
</CodeGroup>

The command above will add the following packages to your project dependencies. We'll begin by installing these packages:

1. `@outspeed/core`
2. `@outspeed/react-native`
3. `react-native-webrtc`
4. `react-native-incall-manager`

</Step>

<Step title="Import the required components in your React Native file">

We will start with importing the neccessary things.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Text, SafeAreaView, Button } from "react-native";
import { registerGlobals } from "react-native-webrtc";
import InCallManager from "react-native-incall-manager";
import { useWebRTC, RealtimePlayer } from "@outspeed/react-native";
import { createConfig } from "@outspeed/core/create-config";
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create a component that uses the useWebRTC hook">

```tsx
export default function HomeScreen() {
  const { connect, remoteStreams, connectionStatus } = useWebRTC();

  const createConfigAndConnect = React.useCallback(async () => {
    InCallManager.setSpeakerphoneOn(true);
    const config = createConfig({
      functionURL: "http://localhost:8080", // Add your WebRTC backend function URL here
      audioConstraints: {}
    });

    connect({
      config,
    });
  }, [connect]);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <Text>Connection Status: {connectionStatus}</Text>
      <Button title="Connect" onPress={createConfigAndConnect} />
      {remoteStreams[0] && (
        <RealtimePlayer stream={remoteStreams[0]} />
      )}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

```

</Step>

<Step title="[OPTIONAL] If you're using Expo">

Since we are using `react-native-webrtc`, which includes native code, it is not available in the
Expo Go app by default. To make it work, you'll need to do the following:

1. Install `expo-dev-client` (follow the guide at [this link](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/)).
2. Install `@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc`.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @config-plugins/react-native-webrtc 
```
</CodeGroup>

After installation, add the [config plugin]((https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/#use-a-config-plugin)) to the plugins array in the Expo
configuration file. This ensures that Expo includes the plugin during the prebuild process.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc"]
		// ...
  }
}
```
</Step>

</Steps>

<Warning>
Don't forget to replace the placeholder functionURL with the actual URL of your WebRTC backend.
