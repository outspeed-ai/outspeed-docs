We assume you already have a React Native project set up. If you don't, please follow the [official guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to create one.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @outspeed/core @outspeed/react-native react-native-webrtc
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @outspeed/core @outspeed/react-native react-native-webrtc
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @outspeed/core @outspeed/react-native react-native-webrtc 
```
</CodeGroup>

`@outspeed/core` and `@outspeed/react-native` are open source, and the code is available on [GitHub]((https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed-js)).

If you come across any bugs or have a feature request, feel free to open an issue. If you're interested in contributing,
you can submit a pull request. We're actively maintaining the repository and appreciate contributions!


### Specific to Expo Apps

Since we are using `react-native-webrtc` internally, which includes native code, it is not available in the Expo Go app by default.
However, you can make it work by using the `expo-dev-client` library along with the out-of-tree 
`@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc` package.

To install expo-dev-client follow the instructions avaialbe here: https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/

Run the following command to install `config-plugins/react-native-webrtc`

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install config-plugins/react-native-webrtc
```

```bash yarn
yarn add config-plugins/react-native-webrtc
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install config-plugins/react-native-webrtc 
```
</CodeGroup>

After installation, add the [config plugin]((https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/#use-a-config-plugin)) to the plugins array in the Expo
configuration file. This ensures that Expo includes the plugin during the prebuild process.

```json app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc"]
		// ...
  }
}
```
