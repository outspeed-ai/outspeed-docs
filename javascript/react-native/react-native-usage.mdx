`@outspeed/react-native` simplifies connecting your React Native app to a backend
deployed with `outspeed-client`. It provides all the necessary components and
hooks to easily establish the connection between your application and the backend.

This guide assumes that you've already deployed your backend using `outspeed-client`,
have a `function URL` ready, and have an existing React Native app set up. If not, please
follow [this tutorial](/outspeed_sdk/cli/deploy) to deploy your backend with
`outspeed-client` and [this tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/) to
set up a new React Native app.

By the end of this guide, you'll learn how to connect your React frontend to
the backend deployed using `outspeed-client`.
