realtime's Web SDK offers a straightforward API that enables web developers to utilize realtime audio/video capabilities efficiently.

### Installation

To install the package, use:

```bash
npm install realtime-client
```

### Importing

To import the package:

```javascript
import realtime from "realtime-client";
```

Next, initialize the realtime class by passing your **Public Key** to the constructor:

```javascript
const realtime = new realtime("your-public-key");
```

Your public key is available in the [Adapt Dashboard](https://getadapt.ai/account).

## Usage

### `.start()`

Initiate a web call using the `.start()` function, which accepts:

1. **a string**, specifically an ID
2. **an object**, detailing configurations


### `.send()`

Send messages during the call:

```javascript
realtime.send({
  type: "add-message",
  message: {
    role: "system",
    content: "The user has pressed the button, say peanuts",
  },
});
```

### `.stop()`

End the call session:

```javascript
realtime.stop();
```


## Events

Listen for various events on the `realtime` instance to respond to call dynamics and user interactions.

#### `speech-start`, `speech-end`

Track when the assistant begins or ends speaking.

```javascript
realtime.on("speech-start", () => {
  console.log("Assistant speech has started.");
});
realtime.on("speech-end", () => {
  console.log("Assistant speech has ended.");
});
```

#### `call-start`, `call-end`

Monitor the beginning and end of calls.

```javascript
realtime.on("call-start", () => {
  console.log("Call has started.");
});
realtime.on("call-end", () => {
  console.log("Call has ended.");
});
```

#### `volume-level`

Receive updates on the assistant's volume level.

```javascript
realtime.on("volume-level", (volume) => {
  console.log(`Assistant volume level: ${volume}`);
});
```

#### `message`

Handle messages sent during the call.

```javascript
realtime.on("message", (message) => {
  console.log(message);
});
```

#### `error`

Manage errors during the call.

```javascript
realtime.on("error", (e) => {
  console.error(e);
});
```
