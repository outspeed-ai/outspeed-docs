`@outspeed/react` simplifies connecting your React frontend to a backend
deployed with `outspeed-client`. It provides all the necessary components and
hooks to easily establish the connection between your application and the backend.

This guide assumes that you've already deployed your backend using `outspeed-client`,
have a `function URL` ready, and have an existing React app set up. If not, please
follow [this tutorial](/todo-add-a-link-to-the-tutorial) to deploy your backend with
`outspeed-client`.

By the end of this guide, you'll learn how to connect your React frontend to
the backend deployed using `realtime-client`.
