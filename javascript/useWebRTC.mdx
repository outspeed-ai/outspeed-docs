<RequestExample>
```ts useWebRTC.ts
import { useWebRTC } from "@outspeed/react"

const {
  connectionStatus,
  connect,
  disconnect,
  reset,
  dataChannel,
  addEventListener,
  removeEventListener,
  getLocalAudioTrack,
  getLocalVideoTrack,
  getLocalTracks,
  getRemoteAudioTrack,
  getRemoteVideoTrack,
} = useWebRTC({
  config
});

```
</RequestExample>

The `useWebRTC` hook handles all the necessary logic to manage a WebRTC connection with the Outspeed's backend.

### Options

#### `config: TRealtimeConfig`
- **Required**
- This configuration is used by the `useWebRTC` hook to initialize local audio and video streams, set up peer connections, enable logging, and more.
- Learn more about `config` [here](./useCreateConfig).

### Returns

#### `connectionStatus: TWebRTCConnectionStatus`
- Possible values:
  - `Init` when the component mounts and `config` is undefined.
  - `SetupCompleted` when `config` is defined but `connect` hasn't been called.
  - `Connecting` when `connect` is called and the connection to the backend is in progress.
  - `Connected` when the connection to the backend is successful.
  - `Failed` if the connection to the backend fails.
  - `Disconnecting` when attempting to disconnect from the backend.
  - `Disconnected` when successfully disconnected from the backend.


#### `connect: () => void`
- A function that initiates the connection to the backend.
- Be sure to call this when `connectionStatus` is `SetupCompleted`, otherwise it will have no effect.

#### `disconnect: () => void`
- A function to disconnect from the backend.
- Be sure to call this when `connectionStatus` is `Connected`, otherwise it will have no effect.

#### `reset: () => void`
- A function to reset the connection.
- Be sure to call this when `connectionStatus` is `Disconnected`, otherwise it will have no effect.
- This will set the `connectionStatus` to `Init`.

#### `dataChannel: WebRTCDataChannel`
- A WebRTC data channel for sending and receiving messages.
- To send a message to the backend, use `dataChannel.send({ type: "message", data: "Hello" })`.
- To listen for messages from the backend, use `dataChannel.addEventListener('message', (message) => console.log(message))`.
- To remove a message listener, use `dataChannel.removeEventListener('message', onMessage)`.
- The available events are `open` (triggered when the data channel opens), `close` (triggered when the data channel closes), and `message` (triggered when a message is received).

#### `addEventListener: (type: TRealtimeConnectionListenerType, listener: TRealtimeConnectionListener) => TUseWebRTCReturn`
- To attach event listener to the RTCPeerConnection.
- Refer to this [MDN doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection#events) to learn more.

#### `removeEventListener: (type: TRealtimeConnectionListenerType, listener: TRealtimeConnectionListener) => TUseWebRTCReturn`
- To remove event listener from the RTCPeerConnection.

#### `getLocalAudioTrack: () => Track | null`
- Returns the first local audio track, or `null` if no audio track is available.
- This is a reactive function that may trigger a re-render when a track is added or removed.

#### `getLocalVideoTrack: () => Track | null`
- Returns the first local video track, or `null` if no video track is available.
- This is a reactive function that may trigger a re-render when a track is added or removed.

#### `getRemoteAudioTrack: (remoteId: string) => Track | null | undefined`
- Returns the first active remote audio track, or `null` if it doesn't exist. If the connection is still in progress, it may return `undefined`. Once the connection is updated, it will return the track.
- This is a reactive function that may trigger a re-render when a track is added or removed.

#### `getRemoteVideoTrack: (remoteId: string) => Track | null | undefined`
- Returns the first active remote video track, or `null` if it doesn't exist. If the connection is still in progress, it may return `undefined`. Once the connection is updated, it will return the track.
- This is a reactive function that may trigger a re-render when a track is added or removed.
