<RequestExample>
```ts useWebSocket.ts
import { useWebSocket } from "@outspeed/react"

const {
    connectionStatus,
    connect,
    disconnect,
    dataChannel,
    getLocalAudioTrack,
    getRemoteAudioTrack,
} = useWebSocket({
  config
});

```
</RequestExample>

The `useWebSocket` hook handles all the necessary logic to manage a web socket connection with the Outspeed's backend.

### Options

#### `config: TRealtimeWebSocketConfig`
- **Required**
- This configuration is used by the `useWebSocket` hook to initialize local audio streams, set up peer connections,
enable logging, and more.
- It is an object with the following properties:
  - `functionURL`: The URL of the function to be called for establishing the connection.
  - `audio`: Audio [constraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints#constraints) 
  that will be passed to the `navigator`.
  - `logger`: Logger configuration for managing and storing logs related to the connection. This must implement
  the [Logger](https://github.com/outspeed-ai/outspeed-js/blob/main/packages/core/src/Logger/Logger.ts) class.

### Returns

#### `connectionStatus: TWebSocketConnectionStatus`
- Possible values:
  - `new` when component/hook mounts.
  - `connecting` when `connect` is called and the connection to the backend is in progress.
  - `connected` when the socket connection to the backend is successful.
  - `failed` if the socket connection to the backend fails.
  - `disconnected` when socket connection disconnected from the backend.


#### `connect: () => void`
- A function that initiates the connection to the backend.

#### `disconnect: () => void`
- A function to disconnect from the backend.

#### `dataChannel: WebsocketDataChannel`
- A WebRTC data channel for sending and receiving messages.
- To send a message to the backend, use `dataChannel.send({ type: "message", data: "Hello" })`.
- To listen for messages from the backend, use `dataChannel.addEventListener('message', (message) => console.log(message))`.
- To remove a message listener, use `dataChannel.removeEventListener('message', onMessage)`.
- The available events are `open` (triggered when the data channel opens), `close` (triggered when the data channel closes), and `message` (triggered when a message is received).

#### `getLocalAudioTrack: () => Track | null`
- Returns the first local audio track, or `null` if no audio track is available.
- This is a reactive function that may trigger a re-render when a track is added or removed.

#### `getRemoteAudioTrack: (remoteId: string) => Track | null | undefined`
- Returns the first active remote audio track, or `null` if it doesn't exist. If the connection is still in progress, it may return `undefined`. Once the connection is updated, it will return the track.
- This is a reactive function that may trigger a re-render when a track is added or removed.
