## Overview

The `@outspeed.App()` decorator is used to define a class as a Outspeed application. This decorator enhances the class, enabling it to interact seamlessly with various Outspeed services and manage the application lifecycle.

## Creating an App

To create an app, define a class and decorate it with `@outspeed.App()`. Here's a minimal example:

```python
import outspeed as sp

@sp.App()
class MyApplication:

    def setup(self):
        # Initialization code here
        print("App is setting up!")

    def run(self):
        # Main logic here
        print("App is running!")

    def teardown(self):
        # Cleanup code here
        print("App is tearing down!")
```

<Info>
  A Outspeed App should have `setup`, `run`, and `teardown` methods, although
  only `run` is strictly required.
</Info>

- The `setup` method is called when the app starts, allowing for initialization.
- The `run` method contains the main logic of the app and is required.
- The `teardown` method is called when the app is shutting down, enabling proper resource cleanup.

## App Lifecycle

The `App` class manages the application lifecycle:

1. It calls the `setup` method asynchronously.
2. It runs the `run` method (as many times as required).
3. After the main execution, it calls the `teardown` method.

## Outspeed Functions

The app can include Outspeed functions, which are methods decorated with `@outspeed.function()`. The current implementation supports only one Outspeed function per app class.

<Warning>
  If more than one Outspeed function is defined in the app class, a RuntimeError
  will be raised.
</Warning>

If a Outspeed function is defined, it will be executed concurrently with the `OutspeedServer`, replacing the need for a separate `run` method.

```python
import outspeed
@outspeed.App()
class MyApplication:
@outspeed.function()
async def my_outspeed_function(self):
# Outspeed function logic here
pass
async def run(self):
# Main app logic here
pass
```

## Best Practices

- Implement `setup` and `teardown` methods in your app class for proper initialization and cleanup.
- Use either a `run` method or a single Outspeed function as the main execution point of your app.
- Use type hints for all method parameters and return types to enhance clarity.
- Limit your app to one Outspeed function to comply with current implementation constraints.
- Implement error handling within your methods to manage exceptions gracefully.
- Test your app thoroughly locally before deploying to ensure all components interact correctly.

By following these guidelines, you can create robust and efficient applications using the Outspeed platform.

## Error Handling

The `App` includes basic error handling:

- If an exception occurs during the app lifecycle (setup, run/Outspeed function execution, or teardown), it will be logged as an error.
- In case of an error, the `OutspeedServer` will be shut down gracefully.

It's recommended to implement your own error handling within your app methods for more specific error management.
