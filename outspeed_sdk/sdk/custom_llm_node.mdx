## Overview

The `CustomLLMNode` class in the Outspeed package is designed to handle custom language model (LLM) processing within Outspeed applications.

It extends the base `Node` class to provide specialized functionality for processing input streams, managing asynchronous tasks, and handling interruptions based on voice activity detection (VAD).

## Creating a CustomLLMNode

To create a custom LLM node, define a class that inherits from `CustomLLMNode` and implement the required methods.

Here's an example based on the provided `nodes.py`:

```python
import outspeed as sp

class MyCustomLLMNode(sp.CustomLLMNode):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Initialize any additional attributes here

    async def process(self, input_data):
        # Implement the LLM processing logic here

```

<Info>
  A `CustomLLMNode` must implement the `process` method to define how input data
  is handled and transformed by the language model.
</Info>

- The `process` method receives `input_data` from the input stream and should return the processed output.
- The node manages input and output streams asynchronously, ensuring efficient data handling.
- Interrupt streams can be set to handle tasks like voice activity detection, allowing the node to respond to specific events.

### Integrating the CustomLLMNode into an Application

Once defined, the `CustomLLMNode` can be integrated into an Outspeed application as follows:

```python
import outspeed as sp

@sp.App()
class VoiceBot:
    async def setup(self) -> None:
        # ... additional setup ...
        self.llm_node = MyCustomLLMNode()
        # ... additional setup ...

    @sp.streaming_endpoint()
    async def run(self, text_input_stream: sp.TextStream) -> sp.TextStream:
        # ... additional logic ...
        text_output_stream = self.llm_node.run(text_input_stream)
        # ... additional logic ...

```

## Tool Lifecycle

The `CustomLLMNode` manages its lifecycle through several asynchronous tasks:

1. **Initialization**: Sets up input and output streams.
2. **Processing**: Continuously processes incoming data from the input stream.
3. **Interruption Handling**: Monitors the interrupt stream (e.g., VAD) to handle events like speech detection.
4. **Closure**: Gracefully shuts down processing tasks when the node is closed.
