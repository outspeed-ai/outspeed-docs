## Overview

The `@outspeed.streaming_endpoint` decorator is used to define asynchronous functions that handle streaming data in outspeed applications. This decorator allows the function to process continuous streams of data such as audio, video, or any other streamable data types.

## Creating Streaming Functions

Streaming functions are defined using the `@outspeed.streaming_endpoint` decorator. Below is an example of how to create a streaming function that processes audio and video streams:

```python
from outspeed import App, streaming_endpoint
from outspeed.streams import AudioStream, VideoStream, Stream

@App()
class MediaProcessor:

    @streaming_endpoint()
    async def run(self, audio_input: AudioStream, video_input: VideoStream) -> Tuple[Stream, ...]:
    # Process the incoming streams
        processed_audio = await self.process_audio(audio_input)
        processed_video = await self.process_video(video_input)
        return processed_audio, processed_video
```

<Info>
  Note the type hints in the function’s arguments. These are strictly required.
  Type hints are picked up by the outspeed package, and are used to generate the
  streams.

## Specifying Additional Data for Streaming Functions

You can customize the environment of your streaming functions using various parameters in the `@outspeed.streaming_endpoint` decorator:

| Parameter       | Type              | Description                                                                      | Default                             |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| name            | str               | Defines the name of the streaming function                                       | Default is determined by the system |
| python_version  | str               | Specifies the Python version to be used                                          | Default is determined by the system |
| python_packages | List[str]         | Specifies additional Python packages to be installed                             | `[]`                                |
| system_packages | List[str]         | Specifies additional system packages to be installed                             | `[]`                                |
| metadata        | outspeed.Metadata | Provides additional metadata about the function to be displayed on the dashboard | None                                |

These parameters help tailor the execution environment to the specific needs of your streaming function, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility.
