<Note>
  This API is currently in Alpha
</Note>

The Outspeed Live API lets you create low-latency, multi-modal conversational experiences by connecting to both OpenAI models and Outspeed's hosted MiniCPM-o models. These models enable realtime text and audio interactions, voice activation detection, function calling, and many other capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-modal Interactions**: Support for text, audio, and visual inputs and outputs
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency responses for natural conversations
- **Contextual Memory**: Maintains conversation history within sessions
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Automatically detects speech start/end for fluid interactions
- **Function Calling**: Integrate external tools and services seamlessly

## Supported Models

### OpenAI Models
- `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`
- `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`

### Outspeed Hosted Models
- `MiniCPM-o 2.6`

You can find dated model snapshot IDs and additional details on the [models page here](/docs/models#live-models).
