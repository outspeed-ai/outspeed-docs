## Overview


## Creating Functions and Models

Functions are defined with the `@realtime.streaming_endpoint` decorator. Here is a minimal example of a function:

```python
from realtime import webrtc

@webrtc()
def multiply(x1: int, x2: int) -> int:
    return x1 * x2
```

Note the type hints in the functionâ€™s arguments. These are not strictly required, but are recommended. Type hints are picked up by the realtime dashboard, and are used to generate the job submission form.

Similarly, models are marked with the `@realtime.Model` decorator. Here is a minimal example of a Model:

```python
import realtime

@realtime.Model(name="adder")
class Adder:
    def __setup__(self):
        print("setting up!")
    def __predict__(self, x1: int, x2: int) -> int:
        return x1 + x2
```

## Calling Functions and Models

Functions and models already deployed on realtime can be referenced by using 

```python
referenced_function = realtime.function.get("{username}/{function name}")
```

There are two options for running `referenced_function` on the realtime cloud. 

### run

The `.run()` method blocks and waits for the function to complete, and directly returns the value returned by the function.
    
    ```python
    import realtime
    
    mult = realtime.function.get("username/multiplier")
    product1 = mult.run(2, 3)
    product2 = mult.run(product1, 4)
    ```
    

### push

The `.push()` method returns a `concurrent.futures.future` object, which resolves to the value returned by the function. You can later access the value of the future using the `.result()` method, for example. This is useful for when you are pushing several jobs at once, like when processing frames from a video. This ensures that you are not waiting for previous frames to finish processing before pushing the next ones, and are taking full advantage of parallel processing.
    
    ```python
    import realtime
    
    mult = realtime.function.get("username/multiplier")
    multiplication_inputs = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
    multiplication_jobs = []
    
    # send all of the jobs first
    for multiplication_input in multiplication_inputs:
        multiplication_jobs.append(mult.push(2, multiplication_input))
    
    # then, once everything is submitted, grab the results
    for multiplication_job in multiplication_jobs:
        print(multiplication_job.result())
    ```
    

You can call both `.run()` and `.push()` locally, or within another realtime function or Model. Calling `.run()` or `.push()` within realtime, allows you to chain function calls together, enabling powerful AI applications!

## Specifying Additional Data for Functions and Models

By default, realtime functions and models live inside Linux containers without a GPU and a limited number of python packages installed. You can use a number of key word arguments in the Model/function decorator in order to customize the environment.

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | str | Defines the name of the function | This field is required |
| gpu | realtime.gpu | Determines whether the function is deployed on a server with a GPU, which GPU it should be deployed to, . See the `Parameter` column in the table in [GPU Acceleration](/guide/custom-apps/gpu-acceleration) for a list of options and for more information about GPU sharing. The default value runs on a machine with no GPU. Any other value is specified with a call to one of the realtime.gpu constructors | `None` |
| python_version | str | Determines the python version installed | Default is determined by python packages |
| python_packages | List[str] | List of python packages to be installed during build | realtime and its dependencies will be installed by default |
| system_packages | List[str] | List of Linux packages to be installed during build | [] |
| cuda_version | str | Version of cuda to be installed (for models with gpu enabled). See below for possible versions. | Default is determined by python packages |
| run_commands | List[str] | List of shell commands to be run during build. Note: these commands currently do not have access to the uploaded code | [] |
| metadata | realtime.Metadata | Extra information about the model to be shown on the dashboard. See below for example. | None |
