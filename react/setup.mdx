description: "Get started with the Outspeed React SDK for realtime voice AI applications"
---

import ServerFastAPI from "/snippets/server-fastapi.mdx";
import ServerExpress from "/snippets/server-express.mdx";

## Installation

Install the React SDK using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @outspeed/react
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @outspeed/react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @outspeed/react
```

</CodeGroup>

## Prerequisites

Before using the React SDK, you'll need:

1. **Outspeed API Key**: Get your API key from the [Outspeed Dashboard](https://dashboard.outspeed.com)
2. **Backend Token Endpoint**: A server endpoint to generate ephemeral keys for client authentication

## Backend Setup

<CodeGroup>
  <ServerExpress />
  <ServerFastAPI />
</CodeGroup>

## Environment Variables

Add your Outspeed API key to your server's environment variables:

```bash
OUTSPEED_API_KEY=your_outspeed_api_key_here
```

<Warning>
  Never expose your Outspeed API key in client-side code. Always generate ephemeral tokens on your backend server.
</Warning>

## Session Configuration

The React SDK uses a `SessionConfig` object to configure voice sessions:

```typescript
import { type SessionConfig } from "@outspeed/client";

const sessionConfig: SessionConfig = {
  model: "outspeed-v1",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  voice: "david", // Voice names must be lowercase. Find more voices at dashboard.outspeed.com
  turn_detection: {
    type: "semantic_vad",
  },
  first_message: "Hello! How can I help you today?", // Optional welcome message
};
```

### Configuration Options

| Option           | Type     | Description                             |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `model`          | `string` | Must be `"outspeed-v1"`                 |
| `instructions`   | `string` | System prompt for the AI assistant      |
| `voice`          | `string` | Voice ID to use for speech synthesis    |
| `turn_detection` | `object` | Voice activity detection settings       |
| `first_message`  | `string` | Optional initial message from assistant |

<Info>You can find available voices for `outspeed-v1` at [dashboard.outspeed.com](https://dashboard.outspeed.com)</Info>
