## Overview

The `@realtime.App` decorator is used to define a class as a Realtime application. 
This decorator enhances the class, enabling it to interact seamlessly with various Realtime services.

## Creating an App

To create an app, you simply define a class and decorate it with `@realtime.App`. Here is a minimal example:

```python
import realtime

@realtime.App()
class MyApplication:

    async def setup(self):
        # Initialization code here
        print("App is setting up!")

    async def run(self):
        # Main logic here
        print("App is running!")

    async def teardown(self):
        # Cleanup code here
        print("App is tearing down!")
```

<Info>A realtime App must have a `run` method.</Info>

The `run` method is called when the app is running, and it is responsible for handling the main logic of the app. 
The `setup` method is called when the app starts, and the `teardown` method is called when the app is about to shut down, allowing for proper resource management.

## Calling Methods within the App

Methods within the app can be called directly if you are running the app locally, or they can be triggered by external events when deployed on the Realtime platform.

## Specifying Additional Data for Apps

You can specify additional metadata and configuration for your app using parameters in the `@realtime.App` decorator:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | str | Defines the name of the app | Default is determined by the system |
| metadata | realtime.Metadata | Extra information about the app to be shown on the dashboard | None |
| cpu | int | The number of CPUs to allocate to the app | 1 |
| memory | int | The amount of memory to allocate to the app | 100mb |
| gpu | int | The number of GPUs to allocate to the app | 0 |
| gpu_type | str | The type of GPU to allocate to the app | None |

Here is an example of specifying additional data:


## Best Practices

- Ensure that all external resources are properly initialized and closed in the `setup` and `teardown` methods.
- Use type hints for all method parameters and return types to enhance clarity and usability in the Realtime dashboard.
- Test your app thoroughly locally before deploying to ensure that all components interact correctly.

By following these guidelines, you can create powerful and efficient applications using the Realtime platform.
