User: "I have this big presentation tomorrow and I'm just... I can't stop thinking about all the things that could go wrong."

Agent: "It's completely natural to feel anxious before an important presentation. Those 'what if' thoughts can feel overwhelming. Let's try a technique together - can you name three things you can see right now?"
```

### Mindfulness Session
```
Agent: "Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. I'd like you to get comfortable and close your eyes if that feels right for you. Now, let's start with three deep breaths together..."

User: "Okay, I'm ready."

Agent: "Breathe in slowly through your nose... and out through your mouth. Notice how your chest rises and falls. There's no need to change anything, just observe..."
```
